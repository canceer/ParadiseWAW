PS3 World At War C++ mod menu (SPRX)

This has been published because:
1. I no longer care to keep it to myself.
2. They say to post your code onto github for jobs and stuff, and I'm fairly proud of this project as I did most of the reverse engineering (well, more like porting the code from a different call fo duty to this one on some stuff but WHATEVER, same difference, I found all the addresses myself and I wrote most of this when I was like 17 soo... Still an important project of mine)

What it includes:

The Paradise SPRX World at War source code! Yay!

Many people have asked for this so if you find it, here it is!


Has many features like aimbots and cool tricks only possible on older call of duty's and anti-cheat against non-host cheats like godmode and noclip.
