# ParadiseWAW
PS3 World At War C++ mod menu (SPRX)

What it includes:
The Paradise SPRX World at War source code! Yay!

Many people have asked for this so, here it is!


Has many features like aimbots and cool tricks only possible on older call of duty's and anti-cheat against non-host cheats like godmode and noclip.

A lot of the code was reverse engineered by guys from unknowncheats, which I ported to PS3/WAW.
