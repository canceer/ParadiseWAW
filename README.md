PS3 World At War C++ mod menu (SPRX)

This has been published because:
1. I no longer need to keep it to myself.
2. I'm building a github portfolio :)

What it includes:
The Paradise SPRX World at War source code! Yay!

Many people have asked for this so, here it is!


Has many features like aimbots and cool tricks only possible on older call of duty's and anti-cheat against non-host cheats like godmode and noclip.

The bulk of the code was reverse engineered by me in 2017(???) but most of the stuff was already done for other call of duties I just had to find (reverse engineer) the equivalent ones for world at war with slight modifications so credit to people from NextGenUpdate and UnknownCheats for information on the call of duty engine in general.
